\maketitle

This report discusses testing of the \verb|ComplexT| and \verb|TriangleT|
classes written for Assignment 1. It also discusses testing of the partner's
version of the two classes. The design restrictions for the assignment
are critiqued and then various related discussion questions are answered.

\section{Assumptions and Exceptions} \label{AssumptAndExcept}
The following assumtions were made:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The arguments provided for the constructor of \verb|ComplexT| class will always be of 
	type float.
	\item The arguments provided for the constructor of \verb|TriangleT| class will always be of type integer and their values will be greater than 0.
\end{itemize}
The following exceptions were handled:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The \verb|recip| method will throw an exception when the value of the denominator variable calculated from the object's real and imaginary numbers is less than or equal 
	to 0 i.e \(x^2 + y^2 <= 0\), x being the real part and y being the imaginary part.
	\item The \verb|div| method will throw a similar exception to \verb|recip| but in this case
	the exception is thrown for the passed in argument's real and imaginary numbers instead.
\end{itemize}


\section{Test Cases and Rationale} \label{Testing}
All of the test cases that were written covers all of the methods in \verb|ComplexT| and 
\verb|TriangleT|. The test cases covers all branches of the code meaning all control flow statements were checked i.e all possible outcomes from if-else were covered. The part of
the code that raised exceptions were also handled specifically. Some methods had edge cases which 
were also handled. Otherwise, the rest of the tests that had no weird input issues were 
handled only once, since that covered all outcomes. On some of the methods that returned
floating value as the output, those cases were tested by rounding the output to 5 decimal places.
By doing so the test will only return passed if the output matches the desired result upto those 5 decimal places, which in turn reduces the floating point error to some degree.


\section{Results of Testing Partner's Code}


\section{Critique of Given Design Specification}
The given design specification is very good and detailed enough to create the desired outcome. 
However, it didn't mention everything possible cases properly and left it ambigous for the developer to decide. For example, the specification didn't mention the outcome for the possiblity of giving a wrong input to any of the classes. In my opinion, the design would be more robust to say that it will take in only a specific type of input and handle the remaining inputs somehow. Also, for the \verb|tir_type| method, the design specification didn't mention what would be 
returned as the output when the provided input corresponds to more than one type of triangle. So, 
the less the design specification contains ambiguity regarding the functionality the more robust
the design specification will become. This will cause the outcome to be more stable.
